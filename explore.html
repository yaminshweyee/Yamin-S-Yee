        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        People are busy (especially college students)! In today’s world, people often have to juggle around multiple responsibilities at once: work, social life, and the dreaded bills. Food expiration 
        and the state of one’s fridge often falls by the wayside, assuming 
        that they’ll work without fault. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case: 
        sometimes the power gets cut, other times multiple food items are already expired long before 
        someone can have the time to go through each item and check for spoilage.
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            That’s where we come in. We want to make it easier to quickly check the contents of the fridge, even when on the go!

            The Top Level is the connection between two things, the Core
            and the TSI. The Core consists of the design itself, while TSI contains all
            references to the target technology libraries. Any communication from the core’s
            I/O’s must pass through the TSI before interacting with the FPGA.

            The functionalities of both of Transmit Engine and Receive
            Engine of the UART. The Transmit Engine was verified when the
            statement is consistently printed on a Serial Terminal. Next the
            Receive Engine was verified when it was able to take in a user
            inputted character and transmit directly to the terminal. The design
            was also able to detect parity errors, framing errors, and overflow
            errors in case the transmission of data from one machine to the next
            was not correct. Additionally, the TramelBlaze was able to service the
            correct engine based on the Port ID’s.           
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            MIB was created to give the TramelBlaze access to the
            on-board Micron Memory. Alongside with the Full UART, the Tramel
            Blaze should be able to take in data from Serial Terminal and write
            those characters into a location in memory. Once an asterisk is
            received by the Receive Engine, the data in the memory will then be
            read by the Tramel Blaze and output to the Serial Terminal.

    <h2>Single Cycle MIPS Processor</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">

        Description:
        </h6>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            The single cycle processor’s instruction execution starts by using the counter to apply the instruction address to the instruction memory.
             After the instruction is fetched,  the register operands used by an instruction address to the instruction memory. 
             After the instruction is fetched, the register operands used by an instruction are specified 
             by the fields of that instruction. Once the operands have been fetched, 
             they can operate on to the compute a memory address and equality check. 
             The result for the ALU must be written to a register as well. 
             If the operation is load or store, the result of ALU is used as an address to either store a value from the registers or load a value from memory 
             into the registers. The result from the ALU or memory is written back into the register file. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            Under the Single Cycle Processor, there are controls signals which are also the inputs, under this project I use the name as RegWrite, ALUSrc, MemWrite, MemtoReg, MemRead which are controlled by the control but since we are not working on 
            control module yet in this project. The given top level is the top level we are given to implement.

            I personally crated this clock wise travelling pixel neon table display for one of the organizations I was in last Spring 2109. I came up with idea since I love neon light and also love decorating for home and so I feel like creating a travel display neon light 
            in clock wise with different color makes the home and room more. I love it since it came out as I expected .

    <h2>UART and Bluetooth</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">

        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            The goal of this project was to control the frequency of a sine wave and the
            brightness of an LED by sending Bluetooth commands via a Bluetooth terminal app on
            an Android device. Two TM4C Launchpads were utilized; one to handle the commands
            received via Bluetooth and the other to update the sine wave frequency or the LED
            brightness. The sine wave will be produced using the same hardware and logic from the
            previous project.
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
            The user will interface will the microcontrollers using a Bluetooth terminal app on
            an Android device. Once the HC-05 module and the terminal app are connected, the
            user can then send commands to change the sine wave frequency or LED brightness.
            For the sine wave frequency, the user must first type an ‘f’, then follow it with a value
            from 262 to 494. To change the brightness, the user must first type a ‘b’, then follow it
            with a value from 0-255. When this data is sent, it will have the ASCII value for carriage
            return attached to it for the microcontroller to properly identify the end of the command.
            Once the microcontroller receives the data, it checks to make sure the value is within
            the specified range, otherwise it will not update the frequency or brightness. If the value
            is within the range, the first microcontroller will send the data to the microcontroller
            responsible for changing the frequency and brightness. The user will then be able to
            see the new sine wave frequency on an oscilloscope or the changed LED on the
            second microcontroller

        I feel like as a woman in STEM, you should never limit your ablities because of other people are saying so.
        You should always follow your dreams no matter how hard it takes. 
        I had so many Experiences in my life that teah me how to become a better me. 
        You should never live in the past but you should always compete with yourself. 
        Where you were before and you are right now is a big difference. 
        You shoud never compare yourself with others because we all have different life paths, backgrounds, and dreams. 
        You are the only one who should always compare yourself and at the same time, don't harsh on yourself too much.
        If there were mistakes, you should learn from them and move on. Keep going and never give up!

        I have several Leadership Experiences and some of them make me grow a lot as a person. 
        Some of them teach me how to handle people and how to work in team and communicate. 
        I feel like it is always important to involve outside of classes.
        It will help you to meet with so many people with different backgrounds.
        It will make you think outside of the box.

        I served as Sentor of College of Engineering at Student Government and I served there from 
        2018-2019 school year. I had great experiences there by meeting with many other leaders with different backgrounds
        and some of them even taught me how to become a better leader in future. I represent as student leader of College of Engineering.
        I wrote resolution with other college senators for whole CSULB campus and researched what 
        College of Engineering students want and need and also met with Dean of College of Engineering and discuss 
        improve change, situations under COE and etc

            I served as PR at SASE during Fall 2018 and SASE was my really first organization which taugh me more about Professionalism 
            and engineering and I could able to meet great mentors who could help me to grow as leader. I had to created serveral 
            event flyers and even I had to created the logo of SASE as CSULB chapter. I could get a chance to attended the National and Regional 
            Conferences of SASE and I could even able to get a chance to see the CEO of Boeing at National Conference.
