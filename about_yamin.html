            Hello, My name is Yamin Yee, I am a recent graduate in Computer Engineering majoring at California State University, Long Beach. I
            graduated on May 19, 2020 along with an honor as Computer Engineering and Computer Science Leadership
            and Service Award, Class of 2020. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
            I also had summer scholar intern at HP Inc and completed in July 2020. It was a remote internship and I
            was able to participate in several projects for the campaigns for COVID-19 related products. During the period
            of internship, I managed how a global business operates, and how business decisions are made. I was also
            trained to explore technology in core business areas including gaming, 3D Print, Personal Computers, data
            analytics and sales. I led the managing the meeting for an individual group which I was assigned to be part of to
            do action items and brainstorming ideas for campaigns. My team worked on the mental health awareness
            campaign product especially focusing on COVID-19,and how people were able to get help for their stress, and
            mental issues through the quarantine period. We also had to calculate the budget of our camping product and we
            had to give a presentation as an individual group. It helped me to develop personal skills such as interviewing,
            building a personal brand, and practicing a growth mindset. I also had to identify the behaviors and mindsets
            required to take risks and innovate for the future.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
            Over the past two years, I learned some programming languages including Verilog FPGA, and I learned
            System on Chip Design class, Operating System and they open my mind window to get into Computer
            Engineering stuffs, programming and chips more. I am really enthusiastic upon building circuits, programming
            and solving problems. I finished the course project of the Single Cycle MIPS Processor by using FPGA verilog
            and also assembly language mainly focused on RISC-V. I also finished a course project which was URAT using
            FPGA Verilog. I also completed my Senior Design project which was Blue Jay- Food Spy and I used Python
            with RaspberryPi3 to track the temperature and also take pictures by using a pi camera. The pi camera sent
            either pictures or videos of the inside fridge. I used the IP address to send the update data of pi after every one
            minute.

        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
        I also created this Website on my own with my own algorithm and my draft by designing with HTML.

        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
            Also I was highly involved in campus activities such as I was President of Engineering Student Council,
            Vice President of Society of Women Engineers and, also I was Senator of College of Engineering, Secretary of
            Associated Engineering Student Council , University Student Union, Board of Trustee, and Public Relation
            Chair of Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. I interned at one of the institutes, and I also used to be a
            peer volunteer before I transferred to CSULB back in community college. I was also an officer of the
            volunteering club as a graphic designer back in my community college.

        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
            During my free time, I like to paint, read fantasy books and hang out with my friends by playing board
            games with them, and my favorite board game is Ticket to Ride. Sometimes I compose the songs on my own by
            playing the ukulele as well. I also love to bike around my neighbor as it is good for my physical health and also
            it relaxes me during my free time.

        I love the work of art and any type of painting. Since my job is writing the codes and checking all the issues in front of Computers
        and sometimes it is good to be away from screen once in a while,and work on something which gives you peace and joy. Usually I love to paint and draw the landscapes
        and also the abstract arts. I usually like to paint some nature views which can potray like peace. I like nature thing even tho I am an Engineer
        ,it is always good that there is something makes you happy without using devices realted with technology once in a while. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">

        My favroite artist is Thomas Kinkade. He painted all these beautiful and peaceful paintings such as 
        waterfalls, light houses, beaches,some American old towns,and really nice and beautiful houses. 
        He also depicted various Christian themes including the Christian cross and churches.

        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        My reading style has been shifting in many diffrent generes through out the years.
        I used to read a lot of scientific books and also self-developement books but lately after I graduated 
        and I have been spending my free time reading a lot of fantasy books, biological books, and also books reatled 
        psychology which will teach you to understand your psychological thinkings and how to cope through the hard times. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        My favorite books are the sereies of "The Chronicles of Narnia", written by C.S Lewis, Rise of the Rocket Girls, The Silmarillion by J.R.R Tolkien,
        The Choice by Edith Eger, Sapiens, The Future of Capitalism and all the biological books about queens of Europe.
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        I don't like to read through devices and I love reading the physical books. I also like to have a little library 
        to safe physical books and so it will let me get away from devices and just read the physical books without any discrations. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        My favorite quote of the reading as following:

        I love exploring in nature and enjoy the wild life. It is always good to get away from city life once in a while to 
        have a fresh air and enjoy the mother of nature.I feel like all our daily life has been filled with so many noises with school,
        work, city life, many other things, and sometimes it is impornt to treat ourselves with quite time to think and process.Also phyiscal 
        exercise is really important and so hiking hleps me a lot to reduce stress and at the same time I can be able to enjoy the nature. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        I have been to so many hiking spots but the one in the picture on the right was at the Echo Mouncation,is a mountain promontory of the San Gabriel Mountains,
        in the Angeles National Forest above Altadena, in Los Angeles County, California. I could able to see the whole entire LA from there and it was so breath taking view. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        I hiked to Hollywood Sign, Santa Ynez Falls, Eaton Canyon Falls, Portuguese Bend Loop and etc.

        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        For me, spending time with people I care is really important. 
        Good freinds are really important to have in life. Good friends don't care about your
        title or what you have, good friends can help you during good times and provide 
        support during bad times. Good friends will be there for you and at the same time, they will
        be there for you no matter how far we are away.
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        I usually give time to my friends even sometimes life can be busy a lot. I usually go hiking,
        having bondfire, small gathering and so sometimes playing board games with them. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        It is also important check in your friends when we are living under busy world and also important to support 
        them emotionally as well. Friends don't make you feel awful but friends make you feel you belong with them.
        We all deserve to have friends like those in our lives. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(8, 8, 83);font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size: large;">
        This is my favorite friendship quote:
